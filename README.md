New beginnings! Shades of Kim Stanley Robinson's 2312. I'm also thinking of a quantum text for whatever reason.

Still thinking of that quantum text, except this time it's Brian Hall's QFT: a tourist guide for mathematicians. It's alright. 

Kim Stanley Robinson is okay, but the novelist I really wanted to put into this guide in the first place is Hannu Rajaniemi.
